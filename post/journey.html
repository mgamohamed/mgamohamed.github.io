					<h1>My Tech Journey</h1>
					<p>In the serene embrace of my hometown, a palpable sense of curiosity enveloped me.
						While my peers lost themselves in outdoor play or the realms of fiction, I found
						sanctuary within the pages of mathematics and physics textbooks. The allure of
						comprehending the universe's intricacies ensnared me from an early age.

				<div class="image main"><img src="../images/tech_journey.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
				<p>As I traversed the landscape of education, my path crystallized: engineering
					beckoned me. The prospect of crafting innovation, untangling complex dilemmas,
					and delving into the minutiae of functionality kindled an unquenchable fire within.
					With resolute determination, I embarked on my undergraduate journey in electronics
					and communication engineering.
				</p>
				<p> Those years unfurled as a whirlwind of revelation and maturation. I relished the
					challenges of my studies, seizing every opportunity to stretch the limits of my
					comprehension. Yet, amid the academic rigors, one constant remained: my fervor for
					software programming.
				</p>
				<p> What had begun as a simple pastime burgeoned into a fervent passion. Coding spoke
					to the depths of my soul, offering a canvas for my creativity and ingenuity. Countless
					late nights were spent bent over my computer, engrossed in the intricate dance of algorithms and
					logic.
				</p>
				<p> As my undergraduate tenure neared its end, I stood at a crossroads. The hunger for
					knowledge still gnawed at me, propelling me toward deeper understanding. With a
					heart pulsating with ambition, I resolved to pursue a master's degree and ultimately a PhD.
				</p>
				<p> It was an arduous odyssey, fraught with obstacles at every turn. Yet, with each hurdle
					surmounted, my passion blazed ever brighter. Immersed in the academic sphere, I
					voraciously consumed every morsel of knowledge.
				</p>
				<p> Venturing deeper into the realm of technology, I marveled at the limitless prospects
					before me. Each revelation, from circuit design intricacies to the elegance of
					microchip architecture, ignited a sense of wonder and anticipation within me.
				</p>
				<p> During my doctoral pursuit, I realized the necessity of expanding my knowledge and
					skills to innovate and troubleshoot effectively. In addition to software development
					and microchip architecture, proficiency in signal processing, analog and digital circuit
					design, computer architecture, and embedded software development became paramount. Thus,
					I resolved to transition to the industry, eager to witness firsthand how companies
					assemble teams to tackle the scientific puzzle.
				</p>
				<p> Now, I stand at the precipice of fruition. Equipped with the acumen to craft solutions
					and devise architectures for significant undertakings, I am witnessing the dividends of my journey.
				</p>
				<p> Ultimately, it was not solely the pursuit of knowledge that propelled me forward, but
					an impassioned yearning to make an indelible mark upon the world. To forge creations
					that would endure beyond my time, pushing the boundaries of possibility.
				</p>
				<p> And so, armed with naught but my fervor and resolve, I embark on the endeavor to
					change the world, one line of code at a time.
